    "summary": "Topological methods are very rarely used in structural health monitoring\n(SHM), or indeed in structural dynamics generally, especially when considering\nthe structure and topology of observed data. Topological methods can provide a\nway of proposing new metrics and methods of scrutinising data, that otherwise\nmay be overlooked. In this work, a method of quantifying the shape of data, via\na topic called topological data analysis will be introduced. The main tool\nwithin topological data analysis is persistent homology. Persistent homology is\na method of quantifying the shape of data over a range of length scales. The\nrequired background and a method of computing persistent homology is briefly\nintroduced here. Ideas from topological data analysis are applied to a Z24\nBridge case study, to scrutinise different data partitions, classified by the\nconditions at which the data were collected. A metric, from topological data\nanalysis, is used to compare between the partitions. The results presented\ndemonstrate that the presence of damage alters the manifold shape more\nsignificantly than the effects present from temperature.",
