    "summary": "This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to\ndistributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to\n(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over\nthe (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation\ndevices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\n`conventional' quantum computers.",

    "summary": "We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\nproposal of building a quantum computer.",

    "summary": "Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in\ncomputer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will\nlikely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,\ncomputation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally\nstochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum\ncomputation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum\nalgorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo\ntechniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum\ncomputation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to\nrevolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be\ngenerated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine\nrandom numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up\nmedian evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This\npaper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and\nquantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and\nquantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much\nfaster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical\nframework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.",

    "summary": "We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems\ncalled qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an\naxiomatization for quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed\nquantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator,\nquantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components for\nquantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of\nqACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify\nquantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the\nframework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it\ncan be used widely in verification for quantum and classical computing mixed\nsystems, such as most quantum communication protocols.",
