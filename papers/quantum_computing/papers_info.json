    "summary": "This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to\ndistributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to\n(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over\nthe (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation\ndevices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing\ndevices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than\n`conventional' quantum computers.",

    "summary": "We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by\nreformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In\nthis formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,\nwhile gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum\noperations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,\nwhich is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric\nway of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative\nproposal of building a quantum computer.",
